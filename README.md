The *UNFINISHED* code for the format of '2 Of These People Are Lying' from the YouTube channel 'Matt and Tom'

This is a game about lying: 
- 1 player is a guesser. Other 3 surfs across Wikipedia and finds random articles about the most random stuff. 
- The names of these articles are written down into pieces of paper (in our case these pieces of paper are bits of code).
- The guesser chooses one randomly.
- The player who picked the article tells the truth about what he/she knows about it and the other 2 LIE.
- The guesser tries to, well, guess who told the truth.

I couldn't fix some issues with the code and I don't have the time to make it a window application so feel free to fix what I've made.
